CPR FEEDBACK DEVICE

The purpose of this work is to implement a cardiopulmonary resuscitation feedback device to recover a patient from cardiac arrest. This feedback device is implemented using AT Mega 328P microcontroller. The force sensitive resistor is used to obtain the pressure applied to the patientâ€™s chest while performing chest compressions. Light Emitting Diode is used as an indicator to understand whether the chest compression performed is good or bad. 30 chest compressions make a single chest compression cycle. For each cycle, parameter like heart rate, beats per minute count and  the time rate for a particular cycle are calculated. The prototype is initially implemented in Arduino integrated development environment. The hardware is then extended to MATLAB software. For MATLAB implementation, the parameter found are computed and various graphs are plotted like the heart rate versus cardiopulmonary resuscitation count, beats per minute count versus time and heart rate versus time. From these, it is observed that BPM count decreases with increase in CPR cycle time.
